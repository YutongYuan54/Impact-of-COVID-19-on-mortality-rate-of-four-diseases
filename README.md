<h1>Will the COVID-19 cause the excess death for human diseases?</h1>
<h2>Evidence based on four diseases data in Ontario: Malignant neoplasms, disease of the heart, accidents, and chronic lower respiratory diseases.</h2>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
2020 Covid-19 pandemic has changed humanâ€™s life in so many ways. In this project, we want to investigate that was there any excess mortality caused by the Covid-19 from either of the four types of disease, which is malignant neoplasms, disease of the heart, accidents, and chronic lower respiratory diseases respectively. To find out the excess mortality caused by Covid-19, the method we use is comparing each disease total mortality data under the forecasting NO Covid circumstance and the reality circumstance (under the Covid). The forecasting NO Covid circumstance is the model with 100 observations that formed by fitting the pre-Covid dataset. The dataset is the mortality data for each of the four types of disease in Ontario Canada from March to November 2020, which can be accessed from Statistics Canada https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/aed00edc-26ad-414c-8aa3-82212059ef8a.
